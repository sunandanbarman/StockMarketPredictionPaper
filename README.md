# StockMarketPredictionPaper
Paper presented on the topic of "Stock market prediction using Artificial Neural Networks"

This repository contains the paper I and Swapnil Agrawal presented in Credenz '10 in PICT college, Pune , India. 
While I no longer have the code with me (lost it on an unfortunate occasion), I have this paper which clearly presents
the ideas and capability of the system we had created. If anyone wants to implement similiar prediction model using ANN,
please feel free to refer to this paper. In case of doubts, feel free to contact me or any of the team members listed below.
